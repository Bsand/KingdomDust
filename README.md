# KingdomDust
In order to get this file to run you need to install Python on your computer https://www.python.org/downloads/.

If you are new to github and need help downloading the file, check out this website https://www.wikihow.com/Download-a-File-from-GitHub. And make sure to save the file as a .py file.

NOTE: Make sure there is a value in every box, even if it is 0, or you will only get "Invalid Entry".

The left side is used to see how much dust you will end up with at the end of the event.

The first box should be your current rate in Billions. This value should be without any hour glasses being used. If you have current hour glasses active, you need to figure out the total without them. If your production counter is showing in millions then you need to convert. (1000 mil = 1 bil | 7613mil = 7.613 bil)

The next box is the time left in hours. If you want to be 100% precise and calculate the minutes too you would need to do (min / 60) and add that decimal point to your hour amount 

The next 7 boxes are to be used if you have hour glasses you are planning on using. You should be using these glasses all at once. The way the math works is (BaseProduction * (All multipliers added)). With the way the math works out you want to have all hour glasses active at the same time, or you will be losing resources.

The last box on the left side is for your current dust total, also in billions. If it is showing in trillions then just multiply it by 1000. (1.348 tril = 1348 bil).

The right side is used to help you calculate how much you would need to spend on glasses to finish the event at a certain goal.

The first box, just like the left side is your current rate in billions.

The second box, again like the left side, is your time left in hours.

The third box is what amount of dust you want to end with in billions. (exp: 20000b = 20t)

The last box is your current dust in billions.

In this example I used the right side in order to find out I needed 1 of the 4.99 pack and one of the 9.99 pack to reach my goal of 20t dust. I then checked the work on the left side by adding the appropriate glasses. It worked! https://gyazo.com/665b4403aec3e480d2a6f4ae8f7393ca
